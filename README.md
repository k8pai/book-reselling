1. First, clone the Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/k8pai/book-reselling.git
```

2. Then, install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn add
# or
pnpm add
# or
bun install
```

3. Finally, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

4. `.env` you need to know, should have...

```bash
DATABASE_URL="mongodb://localhost:27017" // or connect to your database for development purposes.
NEXTAUTH_SECRET='' // generate a secret from https://generate-secret.vercel.app/64
NEXTAUTH_URL='http://localhost:3000'
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
